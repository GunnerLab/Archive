      Divya Kaur Matta is a Ph.D. student in Department of Chemistry, 
      CUNY whose research interest is in the area of Molecular Biophysics. 
      Currently, she is working on calculating the pKa of various residues 
      and their titration responses in proteins using MCCE (Multiconformation Continuum Electrostatics) 
      method for benchmarking in proteins. She holds an excellent academic record, 
      and she is a Gold Medalist in Masters of Chemistry from the University of 
      Delhi and a college topper in Bachelors of Chemistry, University of Delhi, 
      India. Before joining the Ph.D., she was an assistant professor in 
      Department of Chemistry at the University of Delhi for five years. Her excellent 
      academic and professional background is a valuable resource for our research team.
