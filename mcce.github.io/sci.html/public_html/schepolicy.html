<h2 align="left">1. Job cleaning policy</h2>
<p>To ensure  the efficient use of Crebeo computing resources and maintain the health of the system, jobs that have been running over 7 days will be reported to the job owner and system administrator, and jobs at zombie state will be removed immediately by system cleaning tool.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to break a big calculation into small pieces that can finish within 7 days, or programs that can resume from a saved state. </p>
<h2>2. Types of jobs</h2>
<p>Crebeo recommends running computation-intensive jobs with Condor job scheduler. Users are encouraged to submit jobs with Condor from master node. Direct logins and running jobs on computing nodes  are subjected to priority degradation.</p>
<p>While most of the computing nodes are reserved for computation-intensive jobs, some nodes are open to interactive jobs and testing jobs.</p>
<p><u>Computation-intensive jobs</u> are programs that can be left running on computing nodes with minimal supervision. These jobs usually take minutes to days to complete</p>
<p><u>Interactive jobs</u> are most of UNIX shell commands and programs with graphic user interfaces. These jobs interact with users during run time.</p>
<p><u>Testing job</u>s are programs underdevelopment. Developer needs to launch the test/debug codes immediately to reduce cycle time of development.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>3. Reserved nodes</h2>
<p>The following nodes are open to all users. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Master1 is open for user login, job submission, compiling serial jobs, and running interactive programs MatLab and Mathematica. </li>
  <li>Node41 is open for compiling and testing MPI programs, and running Fluent and Evolver.</li>
  <li>Node42 is open for testing MPI programs and running Fluent and Evolver.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other nodes are restricted to regular users. Condor jobs are given highest priority on the reserved computing nodes. There is no need to login to these nodes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Master2 is file server and license server, and no login is granted to regular users. </li>
  <li>Node1 to node 40 are reserved for Condor serial jobs.</li>
  <li>Node 43 to node 81 are available for both serial jobs and  MPI jobs, but prefer MPI jobs. </li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Submitting jobs with Job Scheduler</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor</a> is a distributed job scheduler developed by the computer science department at Univ. of Wisconsin &ndash; Madison. It is used by most computing centers affiliated with <a href="http://www.teragrid.org/">TeraGrid Project</a>.</p>
<p>Crebeo master node is where you submit all jobs to the scheduler. Submitting a job is telling Condor a description file by command:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>condor_submit descriptionfile</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The essential entries of a description file are the path of executable and the location of the working directory. For more detailed explanations on condor description file, visit <a href="http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~jmao/condor.html">&ldquo;Condor in 5 Min&rdquo;</a> . Two example description files are prepared for submitting serial jobs and MPI job on Crebeo:</p>
<p>Example 1, a batch of serial jobs</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#####
# Submit a batch of two serial jobs on crebeo
#####
# Section you do not want to edit
universe = Vanilla
output = run.out
error = condor.err
log = condor.log
getenv = True
#####

# Please customize following entries for your need


executable = /home2/jmao/condor_test/prime.py
#arguments =


initialdir = /home2/jmao/condor_test/run_1
queue


initialdir = /home2/jmao/condor_test/run_2
queue


### End of description file ###

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Example 2, a MPI job</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#####
# Submit one MPI on crebeo
#####
# Section you do not want to edit
universe = Parallel
executable = /home2/condor/bin/mpiscript
Requirements = ((Arch == &quot;x86_64&quot;) &amp;&amp; (LoadAvg &lt; 0.5))
Output = run.out.$(NODE)
Error = condor.err.$(NODE)
Log = condor.log
#####

# Please customize following entries for your need
arguments = your_linked_mpi_program
machine_count = 8

queue
### End of description file ###</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above examples, the &ldquo;universe&rdquo; line tells scheduler to handle the jobs differently. Serial jobs will start as soon as a node is available, but MPI jobs will wait until the number of available nodes matches &ldquo;machine_count&rdquo;.&nbsp; While the first example tells the scheduler the location of working directory explicitly by &ldquo;initialdir&rdquo;, the second example assumes the working directory is where you run &ldquo;condor_submit&rdquo; command.</p>
<p>Condor may take up to 5 minutes to start your jobs even when the resources are actually available. This is due to the job negotiation, load averaging and cleaning up mechanisms of the job scheduler.</p>
<p>After the job submission, the following commands are often used to monitor and manage the queue. In these commands, &ldquo;user&rdquo; is the user login name, cluster is the batch number returned by &ldquo;condor_q&rdquo;, process is the sequence number of a job in a cluster which is also returned by &ldquo;condor_q&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>5. Some useful command combinations:</h2>
<p>To check the working directory of a job in the queue: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>condor_q (to get cluster and process number)
condor_q &ndash;l Cluster.process | grep Iwd</pre>
</blockquote>
<p> To check the working directory of a finished job: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>condor_history (to get cluster and process number)
condor_history &ndash;l Cluster.process | grep Iwd </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs removed by condor_rm might get stuck with state &ldquo;X&rdquo; in condor_q. If state &quot;X&quot; doesn't go away in 10 minutes, the following command will force the removal of these jobs: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>condor_rm -forcex job_id
</pre>
</blockquote>
