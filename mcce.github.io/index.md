MCCE (Multi-Conformation Continuum Electrostatics) is a biophysics simulation program combining continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics. 
In this program, the protein side chain motions are simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by continuum electrostatics.

* * *

### What can MCCE do
> Protein structural responses to changes in charge
>
> Changes in charge state of ionizable residues due to structural changes in the protein
>
> The structural and ionization changes caused by changes in solution pH or Eh
>
>Find the location and stoichiometry of proton transfers coupled to electron transfer
>
>Make side chain rotomer packing predictions as a function of pH
